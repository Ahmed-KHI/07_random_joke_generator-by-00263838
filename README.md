Project Title: Random Joke Generator

Day 7: Random Joke Generator

Description: The Random Joke Generator is an engaging web application that fetches and displays random jokes from an external API. This lighthearted tool provides users with a fun way to lighten their day, offering a simple interface and quick access to a new joke at the click of a button.

Functionalities:

Random Joke Fetching: The app retrieves a random joke from the Official Joke API, ensuring a fresh and unique experience each time.

Joke Display: Jokes are displayed in a visually appealing format, making them easy to read and enjoy.

User Interaction: A dedicated button allows users to fetch a new joke instantly, promoting engagement and interaction.

This project marks my seventh milestone in the 30 Days of 30 Projects challenge, part of the Governor IT Program designed to enhance practical coding skills. Through this project, I improved my understanding of asynchronous programming, API integration, and user interface design, creating a delightful tool for anyone in need of a good laugh.
